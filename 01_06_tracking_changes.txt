# COMMIT CHANGES 
# We see changes not staged for commit section and our file is marked 
# as modified:
# This means that a file Git knows about has been modified by us but 
# has not yet been committed. 
# So we can add it to the staging area and then commit the changes:

git add paper.md 
git commit # Use commit msg  "Write Introduction"					

# Let's work some more on our article.
# In our introduction, we should cite a paper describing 
# the main instrument used.

# ** FILE EDITS ** 
# Add the following to the introduction section:
#
# Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004)
#

# Let’s also create a file references.txt to hold our references:

nano references.txt

# ** FILE EDITS **
# Add the following line to references.txt
# 
# Bloggs et al 2004, Describe PCASP instrument.
