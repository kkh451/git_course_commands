# DISCARDING LOCAL CHANGES
#
# There are a number of things which we can amend and change after they 
# have been commited in Git.

# Maybe we made our change just to see how something looks, or to quickly 
# try something out. But we may be unhappy with our changes. 
#
# If we haven’t yet done a git add we can just throw the changes away 
# and return our file to the most recent version we committed to the 
# repository by using: git cheeckout paper.md
#
# Let's make a small edit to the paper.md file e.g. some Acknowledgements
# 

# ** FILE EDITS ** 
# 
# Add the following lines to paper.md
# 
# # Acknowledgements" 
#

# Discard edits we just made
git checkout paper.md	

# And we can see that our file has reverted to being the most up-to-date 
# one in the repository:
# First, let's check the status of our repostory: 

git status			

# We see that we have a clean working directory

# Then let's  inspect file to verify changes have been discarded
tail -n10 paper.md
 
# - END -
