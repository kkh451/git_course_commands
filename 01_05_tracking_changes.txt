#    SECTION - COMMIT CHANGES - 1/3
#========================================================================

# COMMIT CHANGES 

# In order to tell Git to record our change, our new file, 
# into the repository, we need to commit it:

git commit # Type a commit message: "Add title and authors"

# Save the commit message and close your text editor (gedit, notepad etc.)
# If we save our commit message and exit the editor, Git will 
# now commit our file.

# Now, if we look at its status,

git status

# Our file is now in the repository. 

# Now we will work a bit further on our paper.md file by writing 
# the introduction section.

#
# ** FILE EDITS **
# 
# Add the following lines of text to paper.md
#
#  # Introduction
#  
#  We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa
#

# If we now run,

git status

# we see changes not staged for commit section and our file is 
# marked as modified...
#
