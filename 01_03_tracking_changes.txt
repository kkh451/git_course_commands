# TRACKING FILES WITH A GIT REPOSITORY

# Now, we’ll create a file. 
# Let’s say we’re going to write a journal paper, so we will start 
# by adding the author names and a title, then save the file.

nano paper.md

# ** FILE EDITS **
#
# Add the following lines of text to file  paper.md
#
#  # Title 
#  Ageing of biomass burning aerosols over West Africa
#  
#  # Author 
#  Kamilla Kopec-Harding
# 

# git status allows us to find out about the current status of files in 
# the repository. So we can run,

git status

# Information about what Git knows about the directory is displayed. 
#
# The output tells that:
# - We are on the master branch, which is the default branch in a Git 
#   respository  (one way to think of branches is like parallel 
#   versions of the project - more on branches later).
#
# - For now, the important bit of information is that our file is 
#   listed as Untracked which means it is in our working directory 
#   but Git is not tracking it - that is, any changes made to this 
#   file will not be recorded by Git.
#
# - END -
