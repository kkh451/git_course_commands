#    SECTION - CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY

# CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY

# See the course notes to setup a remote repository on GitHub.
# Once you have set up a remote repository on GitHub,  
# You’ll get a page with new information about your repository. 
# We already have our local repository and we will be pushing it to GitHub, 
# so this is the option we will use:

# You'll need to modify this command with YOUR username 
#
# $ git remote add origin https://github.com/<USERNAME>/paper.git 
#
# This sets up an alias origin, to correspond to the URL of our new 
# repository on GitHub.

git remote add origin https://github.com/kkh451/paper.git
git push -u origin master


# PUSH LOCALLY TRACKED FILES TO A REMOTE REPOSITORY
# Now copy and paste the second line,

git push -u origin master 

# This pushes our master branch to the remote repository, 
# named via the alias origin and creates a new master branch in the 
# remote repository.

# Now, on GitHub, we should see our code and if we click the Commits tab we should 
# see our complete history of commits.

# Our local repository is now available on GitHub. 
# So, anywhere we can access GitHub, we can access our repository.
