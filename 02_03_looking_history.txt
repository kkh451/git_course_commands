# LOOKING AT OUR HISTORY

# This strange concept of the ‘detached HEAD’ 
# is covered in the next section … just bear with me for now

# If we look at paper.md we’ll see from the file contents that it’s 
# our very first version. 
cat paper.md

# And if we look at our directory, then we see that our references.txt 
# file is gone:
ls
paper.md

# But, rest easy, while it’s gone from our working directory, 
# it’s still in our repository. 
# We can jump back to the latest commit by doing:

git checkout master

# And references.txt will be there once more,

ls

# So we can get any version of our files from any point in time. 
# In other words, we can set up our working directory back 
# to any stage it was when we made a commit.
