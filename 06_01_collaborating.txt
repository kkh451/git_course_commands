# PULLING CHANGES FROM A REMOTE REPOSITORY

# Now when we have a remote repository, we can share it and collaborate 
# with others (and we can also work from multiple locations: for example 
# from a laptop and a desktop in the lab). 
# 
# But how do we get the latest changes? 
# Git allows us to get the latest changes 
# down from a repository.

# We’ll first do a “dry run” of pulling changes from a remote repository 
# and then we’ll work in pairs for some real-life practice.

# First, let us leave our current local repository,
cd ..  
ls

# And let us clone our repository again, but this time specify the 
# local directory name,

git clone https://github.com/kkh451/paper.git laptop_paper 
ls

# Let’s pretend these clones are on two separate machines! 
# So let’s go into one of our clones, add a figures section, 
# commit the file and push these changes to GitHub:

# Switch to the 'paper' directory
cd paper 

# ** FILE EDITS ** 
# Add figures section to paper.md
#
# # Figures
# Figures go in their own section in a draft paper.
# 
git add paper.md 
git commit -m "Add figures"
git push
