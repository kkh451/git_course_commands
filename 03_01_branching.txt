# BRANCHING IN PRACTICE
# 
# One of our colleagues wants to contribute to the paper but is not quite 
# sure if it will actually make a publication. 
#
# So it will be safer to create a branch and carry on working on this 
# “experimental” version of the paper in a branch rather than in the 
#  master.

git checkout -b simulations

# We’re going to change the title of the paper and update the author list 
# (adding John Smith). 
# However, before we get started it’s a good practice to check 
# that we’re working on the right branch using the command `git branch`.

git branch

# The * indicates which branch we’re currently in. 
# Now let’s make the changes to the paper.

# ** FILE EDITS ** 
#  
# CHANGE the title to: 
# Simulations of biomass burning aerosols over West Africa
# 
# ADD the following to the author list:
# John Smith
# 

git add paper.md
git commit -m "Modify title and add John as co-author"
