# LOOKING AT DIFFERENCES

# We should reference some previous work in the introduction section. 
# We will make the required changes, save both files but will not commit 
# the changes straight away. 

# First we will cite previous studies in the introduction
#
# ** FILE EDITS ** 
# 
# Add the following lines to the introduction in paper.md
#
# Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, 
# but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made
#
# Then add the reference to references.txt
#
# ** FILE EDITS ** 
#
# Add the following lines to references.txt
#  
# Jones et al 1998, Previous studies
# 

# We can review the changes that we made using the `git diff` commnd:

git diff

git add paper.md references.txt 
git commit -m "Cite previous work in introduction"
