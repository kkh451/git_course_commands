# AMENDING THE MOST RECENT COMMIT
#
# If you just made a commit and realised that either you did it a bit too 
# early or your commit message is not as it is 
# supposed to be. You can fix that using the command  `git commit --amend`
# 
# Let’s try it on our example. 
# First, let’s modify two files: our paper file and the references file. 
# We will add a methodology section to the paper where we detail the model 
# used for the simulations, and add a reference for this to the references file.
# 
# Let's add  a methodology section, including a reference to model


#  ** FILE EDITS ** 
# Add the following section to  paper.md
# 
# # Methodology 
#
# We compared our measurements of particle aging with a model simulation.
# The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.
#
# ** FILE EDITS **  
# Add new reference for the model used to references.txt
#
# Smith et al 2002, Atmospheric box model
# 

# Let's  get a status update on file modifications
git status			

# Let’s then add and commit paper.md but not the references file.
# First, let's add paper.md to the staging area.

git add paper.md		 
git commit -m "Describe methodology"

# Let’s have a look at our working directory now:
git status

# Also, run git log -2 to see what is the latest commit message and ID.
git log -2

# Now, we want to fix our commit and add the references file.
# Add reference file
git add references.txt	

# Next we will amend the most recent commit using
#
# $ git commit --amend
#
# This will again bring up the editor and we can amend the commit message if required.
# In this case, we will keep the original commit message, so we will save and close 
# the text editor when it pops up.

git commit --amend

# Now when we run git status and then git log we can see that our 
# Working Directory is clean and that both files were added.

git status
git log -3
