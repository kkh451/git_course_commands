# PUSH CHANGES TO A REMOTE REPOSITORY 

# We can use our cloned repository just as if it was a local repository 
# so let’s make some changes to our files and commit these.

# We'll continue working on the master branch
git checkout master				

# Lets add a results section
#
# ** File Edits ** 
#
# # Results
# The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth
# mechanism for these particles.
#

# Stage changes
git add paper.md			
git commit -m "Discuss results”

# Having done that, how do we send our changes back to the remote repository? 
# We can do this by pushing our changes,
git push origin master

# If we now check our GitHub page we should be able to see our new 
# changes under the Commit tab.
# To see all remote repositories (we can have multiple!) type:

git remote -v
