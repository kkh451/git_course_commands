#========================================================================
#    EPISODE - COLLABORATING WITH A REMOTE REPOSITORY
#    SECTION - PULLING CHANGES FROM A REMOTE REPOSITORY
#========================================================================

# Now let’s change directory to our other repository and fetch the commits 
# from our remote repository,

# Switch to the other directory
cd ../laptop_paper		
git fetch

# We can visualise the remote branches in the same way as we did for local 
# branches, so let’s draw a network graph before going any further:
git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline

# As expected, we see that the origin/master branch is ahead of our local 
# master branch by one commit — note that the history hasn’t diverged, 
# rather our local branch is missing the most recent commit on origin/master.

# We can now see what the differences are by doing,
git diff origin/master

# which compares our master branch with the origin/master branch which is 
# the name of the master branch in origin which is the alias for our cloned 
# repository, the one on GitHub.

# We can then merge these changes into our current repository, but given 
# the history hasn’t diverged, we don’t get a merge commit — instead we get 
# a fast-forward merge.
git merge origin/master

# If we look at the network graph again, all that has changed is that master 
# now points to the same commit as origin/master.
git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline -4

# We can inspect the file to confirm that we have our changes.
cat paper.md 

# As a short-hand, we can do a git pull which does a git fetch then a git 
# merge. Next we will update our repo using pull, but this time starting 
# in the laptop_paper folder (you should already be in the laptop_paper folder). 
# Let’s write the conclusions:

# ** FILE EDITS ** 
# Add the following section to paper.md
#  
# # Conclusions
# We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
# Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.
#

git add paper.md 
git commit -m "Write Conclusions" 
git push origin master
