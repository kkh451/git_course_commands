# MERGING AND RESOLVING CONFLICTS

# Git cannot complete the merge because there is a conflict. 
# If you recall, after creating the new branch, 
# we changed the title of the paper on both branches. 
# We have to resolve the conflict and then complete the merge. 
# We can get some more detail

git status

# Let’s look inside paper.md:

cat paper.md

# The mark-up shows us the parts of the file causing the conflict and 
# the versions they come from. 
# We now need to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict. 

# ** FILE EDITS **
# We edit the file. Then commit our changes:
#
# CHANGE the title to:
# Aircraft measurements and simulation of burning biomass aerosols over 
# West Africa.
#
# REMOVE any markup added by git
#
#

# Let Git know we have resolved the conflict
git add paper.md		
git commit

# We can see the two branches merged if we take another look at the log 
# graph:

git log --graph --decorate --all --oneline

# - END -
