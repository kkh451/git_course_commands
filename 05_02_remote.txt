#========================================================================

# PUSH OTHER LOCAL BRANCHES TO A REMOTE REPOSITORY

# Let’s push each of our local branches into our remote repository:

# First, list all branches (local and remote):
git branch -a

# Now lets push each of them to GitHub
git push origin simulations

# The branch should now be created in our GitHub repository.


# CLONING A REMOTE REPOSITORY

# Now, let’s do something drastic! (but before that step, make sure that 
# you pushed all your local branches into the remote repository)
# Let's delete the paper directory.

cd .. 
rm -rf paper

# Gulp! We’ve just wiped our local repository! But, as we’ve a copy on GitHub 
# we can just copy, or git clone that,
git clone https://github.com/kkh451/paper.git 

# Now, if we change into paper we can see that we have our repository,
cd paper 
git log

# and we can see our Git configuration files too:
ls -A

# In order to see the other branches locally, we can check them out as before:
#  Show remote branches
git branch -r					

# Check out the simulations branch
git checkout simulations
