# CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY WITH GIT

# In this tutorial, we will use the example of writing and tracking
# changes to an academic paper to learn about version control with git.
# - First, we will work on our paper as a single author.
# - Later we will collaborate with our colleague John Smith
#   at the University of Elsewhere  

# First let's create a directory within your home directory 

cd ~

# Let's check that we are in our home directory as planned
# (output should be /home/username)

pwd

# Let's create a folder to hold our project files
# and then navigate into it

mkdir paper
cd paper

# Now we need to set up this directory to be a git repository
# or "initiate the repository". 

git init

# The directory paper is now our working directory. 
# If we look in this directory, we'll find a .git directory. 

ls .git 

# We have now set up our first git repository
# - END -
