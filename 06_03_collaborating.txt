# PULLING CHANGES FROM A REMOTE REPOSITORY

# Switch back to the paper directory
cd ../paper			

# Get changes from remote repository
git pull origin master	

# This is the same scenario as before, so we get another fast-forward merge.
# We can check that we have our changes:

cat paper.md 
git log


# CONFLICTS AND HOW TO RESOLVE THEM

# Let’s continue to pretend that our two local, cloned, repositories are 
# hosted on two different machines. You should still be in the original 
# paper folder. Add an affiliation for each author. Then push these 
# changes to our remote repository:

# Add author affiliations

# ** FILE EDITS ** 
# 
# # Author
# John Smith, University of Elsewhere
# Kamilla Kopec-Harding, University of Manchester
# 

git add paper.md 
git commit -m "Add author affiliations"
git push origin master
