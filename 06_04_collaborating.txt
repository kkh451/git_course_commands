#    EPISODE - COLLABORATING WITH A REMOTE REPOSITORY
#    SECTION - CONFLICTS AND HOW TO RESOLVE THEM 
#======================================================================================

# Our push fails, as we’ve not yet pulled down our changes from our 
# remote repository.Before pushing we should always pull, so let’s do that…
#
git pull origin master
git status

#
# We can see that our file is listed as Unmerged. 
# If we look at paper.md, we see something like:
tail -n 10  paper.md 

# The mark-up shows us the parts of the file causing the conflict and the versions
# they come from. 
#
# We edit the file. Then commit our changes.
#

# ** File Edits **
# Change authorship section to:
# 
# Author
# John Smith, University of Elsewhere
# Kamilla Kopec-Harding, University of Manchester
#

git add paper.md		# Stage the file
git commit # Commit to mark the conflict as resolved

# Now, if we push, all goes well.
#
git push origin master

#
# If we now go to GitHub and click on the “INSIGHTS:NETWORK” tab we can see 
# where our repository diverged and came together again.
#
# We’ll finish by pulling these changes into the other copy of the repo (desktop, paper), so 
# both copies are up to date:
#
cd ../paper			# Switch to 'paper' directory
git pull origin master	# Merge remote branch into local

# Success!
# - End -
