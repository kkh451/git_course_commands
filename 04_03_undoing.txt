#    EPISODE - UNDOING CHANGES
#    SECTION - UNDO CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH A COMMIT (AMEND)
#========================================================================

# Let’s have a look at our working directory now:
git status

# Also, run git log -2 to see what is the latest commit message and ID.
git log -2

# Now, we want to fix our commit and add the references file.
# Add reference file
git add references.txt	

# Next we will amend the most recent commit using
#
# $ git commit --amend
#
# This will again bring up the editor and we can amend the commit 
# message if required.
# In this case, we will keep the original commit message, so we 
# will save and close 
# the text editor when it pops up.

git commit --amend

# Now when we run git status and then git log we can see that our 
# Working Directory is clean and that both files were added.

git status
git log -3
